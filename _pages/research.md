## Broad areas of research

We work in the domain of strongly correlated electrons studying emergent properties in various systems of interacting fermions. We focus on the following areas in our research:

- Frustrated quantum magnetism, 
- Fermionic Criticality and Many-particle entanglement
- Unconventional Superconductivity and Search for quantum materials
- Topological Order and Low-dimensional systems

As a research group, EPQM is keenly interested in systems of interacting fermionic matter, their criticality and the associated emergent forms of quantum matter. This includes systems of strongly correlated electrons, as well as quantum spin systems. We are working towards understanding how quantum fluctuations in such systems, and the long-range entanglement they give rise to, arises from the interplay of the pauli exclusion principle, kinetic energies and inter-particle interactions. This involves the creation of a new language (i.e., new tools and techniques) for fermionic criticality. Also, testing how well this new language describes experimentally observed phenomena.

## Methods we use (and develop)

We employ, as well as develop, analytic and numerical methods to find answers to our questions. This includes
- Variety of RG methods to determine quantum phase diagrams (critical, saddle and stable fixed points). Have developed an RG scheme that leads to stable fixed points at intermediate coupling.
- Methods by which to identify the appropriate quantum order parameters for topological states of matter. These are composite objects that lead to quantum ordered ground states. They are represented by operators that exploit emergent symmetries and lead to topological quantum dynamics.
- Understood how to use quantum interference criteria (e.g. OYA) in determining creation of gap or not. Employed ideas from graph theory, algebraic topology, number theory etc. creatively to our advantage.
- Probing topological features of sum rules that govern spectral weight transfer (e.g., Luttinger’s count of the Fermi volume, Friedel sum rule)

## Questions we have worked on

### Strong correlations and exotic superconductivity

Strongly correlated systems often show the proximity of unconventional superconductivity, non-Fermi liquids and insulating magnetic states of quantum matter. Well known examples include the cuprates and heavy fermion systems. We are interested in understanding how the enhanced quantum fluctuations in low-dimensional (e.g., two dimensional) versions of such systems can enhance the emergence of complexity.

- Can a system of repulsively interacting electrons give rise to superconductivity upon tuning some parameters (e.g., hole doping, pressure etc.)?
    - Can doping the ½-filled 2D Hubbard model explain the complexity observed in the cuprate high-TC superconductors' phase diagram?
    - Does the Pseudogap phase collapse towards a QCP within the SC dome?
- Can attractive interactions between electrons lead to a insulating state of Cooper pairs (instead of the broken symmetry that leads to superconductivity)? 
- Can we understand the nature and properties of metals beyond the paradigm of the Landau Fermi liquid?
- Can we formulate a language for the exploration of non-local (or topological) ordering of matter?

### Topological phases, symmetry breaking and entanglement

Topological states of matter are known to be governed by rules that depart from the traditional Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson paradigm of local order parameters and spontaneous symmetry breaking. The entanglement properties of the many-body Hilbert space are believed to be key to the ongoing search for topological order in quantum matter. We are presently focussed on asking how topological order can arise in correlated fermionic quantum matter.

- Can we formulate a language for the exploration of non-local (or topological) ordering of matter?
    - How does many-particle entanglement lead to the creation of the novel gauge degrees of freedom that are found in topological quantum field theoretic approaches to some quantum liquids?
    - Can the multi-particle entanglement of topologically ordered states of quantum matter be understood using measures of quantum information?
- Can we build a systematic understanding of many-particle entanglement that can help classify the “universality classes” of quantum matter?
    - Where did these quantum fluctuations come from? Could they have existed in momentum-space in a UV theory of interacting electrons?
- Is something universal about such quantum fluctuations?
- How does this relate to the idea of holographic entanglement renormalization for gapless states?

### Fermionic criticality and correlated 1D models

Quantum criticality associated with correlated electrons likely require order parameters that describe the geometry and topology of the Fermi surface. We are interested in investigating quantum phase transitions that involve drastic changes in the exchange statistics of excitations lying above the ground state and changes in the topology of the Fermi surface (Lifshitz transitions).

- How does Fermi surface topology shape the criticality of a system of interacting fermions? 
- Can this be tested in a (relatively) simple model such as the 1D Hubbard model?

### Fustrated magnetism and spin liquids	

The study of frustrated magnetism is at the heart of the search for liquid-like states arising in systems of interacting quantum spins. Such states do not display any ordering of the constituent spins even at T=0. Instead, there exist predictions of topological order in some gapped spin liquid states. We are interested in investigating whether such proposals can be realised in geometrically frustrated systems like the Kagome or pyrochlore lattices.

- Can frustrating interactions in a system of quantum spins lead to novel ground states that do not show local magnetic order (spin liquids)?
- Is it possible to stabilise the orbital & spin liquid states in insulating transition metal compounds?
- Using non-perturbative T=0 analytic methods, can we characterise the m=1/3 magnetisation plateaux in the kagome XXZ antiferromagnet?
- Can we extend the LSM and OYA theorems to the triangular lattice, the kagome lattice in 2D and the pyrochlore lattice in 3D?

These are like the familiar phases .. but with more exotic and complicated configurations enabled by throwing superposition and entanglement into the mix."

### Quantum impurities & auxiliary models

Correlated quantum impurity models serve as fertile grounds for the emergence of various quantum-mechanical properties like entanglement, frustration, non-Fermi liquid physics and quantum phase transitions. They also find use as auxiliary models in methods like dynamical mean-field theory. The rich physics in these models often means that different methods lead to new insights on already-solved problems.

- What is the physics of the Kondo cloud (by which quantum impurities are screened by conduction baths in, e.g., the Kondo problem)? 
- Why does the Kondo screening breakdown in the multichannel problem?
- Is there a minimal version of the single impurity Anderson model that displays a metal-insulator transition?
- What does it teach us about the MIT in higher dimensional strongly correlated electron systems?

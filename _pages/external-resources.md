## YouTube channels of [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium/featured) and [PBS Space Time](https://www.youtube.com/@pbsspacetime/featured)

Both Veritasium and PBS Space Time release YouTube videos about (among other things) science. While PBS focuses particularly on various topics of physics and is slightly more technical, Veritasium on the other hand covers more general questions of science and interesting aspects of nature.

To get a taste for their content, check out these two videos of theirs which we found particularly enlightening. The [first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1bSDnuIPbo&ab_channel=Veritasium) is a video by Veritasium that explains exactly how the image of Sagittarius A* (the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy) was captured. The [second one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyn7MusdQ9g&t=869s&ab_channel=PBSSpaceTime) is a video by PBS that describes the liquid-gas coexistence phase beyond the critical point of water.

## [PhD Comics](https://phdcomics.com/)

'*Piled Higher and Deeper* (PhD) is the comic strip about life (or the lack thereof) in academia'. Written and drawn by Jorge Cham, the comic follows the lives of graduate students and their professors. The title of the comic comes from an old joke about becoming a Ph.D., which explains that "B.S." stands for "bullshit", "M.S." stands for "More of the Same" (or "More Shit"), and "Ph.D." stands for "Piled Higher and Deeper". Reviewer Sara Coelho said "the comic deals with everyday frustrations of life in the lab â€“ procrastination, dealing with advisers, serving on committees, lack of inspiration".

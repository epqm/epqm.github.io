# What is EPQM?

**EPQM** (Emergent Phenomena in Quantum Matter) is a research group at IISER Kolkata lead by Dr. **Siddhartha Lal** in the Department of Physical Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata, India. We engage in theoretical research on various topics in the **condensed matter physics of quantum matter**, ranging from strongly-correlated electronic systems, quantum magnetism, topological phases of matter, non-Fermi liquids and low-dimensional systems.

Here is an example of what we work on. One of our primary goals is to understand the fascinating and complex phenomenology displayed by many materials studied in the laboratory. An excellent example is the **phenomenon of high-temperature superconductivity** displayed by the Cuprate family of materials. These materials are planar: they are comprised of a set of planes of Copper and Oxyegen atoms that are almost isolated from one another. In their pure form, these materials are **Mott insulators** (i.e., insulators whose physics is driven by strong inter-electron repulsion) that turn into a superconductor at low temperatures upon doping with holes. Even the normal metallic state shown by them at high temperatures with hole doping is unfamiliar, i.e., it is clearly not the Fermi liquid we understand well, and has come to be known as a **strange metal**. The community working towards understanding these phenomena largely agrees that they arise from strong and local electronic correlations of the electrons running about in the planes. The relevant simplest model in which to seek answers is the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice. And that is we did in some of our recent works. But this is far from being a simple task: we seek to understand the quantum physics of an Avogradro number of electrons (that is roughly 6 followed by 23 zeros!) that are interacting with one another. And the physics we seek appears to lie when the electronic potential energy (due to electron repulsion) is of the same order as their kinetic energy. Thus, approaches that rely on using perturbation theory of any kind are bound to fail.     

In keeping with this, our work has often involved the development of non-perturbative methods like a novel **renormalisation group method**, twist operator-based techniques and momentum-space entanglement renormalisation group approaches. We also use familiar field-theoretic, many-body theoretic and quantum statistical mechanical methods in conjunction with those we build. Many of our results derive ideas from areas of mathematics such as **topology**, number theory, graph theory, quantum information theory, non-linear dynamics and even machine learning.

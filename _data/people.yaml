Alumni:
  - title: Santanu  Pal
    excerpt: "Developed spectral flow-based criteria for the existence of novel gapped quantum liquid ground states in frustrated quantum spin systems (e.g., the Heisenberg and XXZ models on the pyrochlore, kagome and triangular lattices). Studied the coupled orbital, spin and phonon dynamics in a prototypical magnetic insulating spinel."

    thesis: "Orbital and spin dynamics in geometrically frustrated lattices"
  - title: Anirban Mukherjee
    excerpt: "Created a non-perturbative renormalisation group-based framework for the study of strongly correlated electronic systems. Obtained fresh insight from this framework on challenging open questions in several important models, e.g., d-wave superconducitvity in the hole-doped 2D Hubbard, how Fermi surface topology shapes fermionic criticality, a theory for the Kondo screening cloud etc."

  - title: Siddhartha Patra
    excerpt: "Studied the nature of multi-partite entanglement in various gapped and gapless liquid phases of quantum matter, leading to a deeper understanding of topological entanglement entropy. Also studied the nature of topological order in the Cooper pair insulating gapped quantum liquid."

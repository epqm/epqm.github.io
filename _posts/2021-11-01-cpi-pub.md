Superconductivity arises from the pairing of electrons when they suffer attractive interactions at sufficiently low temperatures. The superconducting ground state is formed by the condensation of many such Cooper pairs, and it's wavefunction characterised by a non- zero expectation value of the global phase. But this needs the spontaneous breaking of a U(1) global phase rotation symmetry. Based on phenomenological topological quantum gauge-field theoretic arguments, a symmetry preserved counterpart to the superconducting state has been proposed in the past. This is an insulating state of matter comprised of Cooper pairs, referred to as the Cooper pair insulator (CPI).

Using a host of non-perturbative methods developed recently in Dr. Siddhartha Lal's research group at IISER Kolkata, a new work from this group presents a microscopic theory for such a Cooper Pair Insulator. This allows an exploration of the topological properties of this system, including a glimpse of the many-particle entanglement encoded in its degenerate ground states. This work opens the door to a systematic exploration of other topologically ordered states of matter.
